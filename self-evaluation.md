# Arrays: Self-Evaluation

### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Right now I am feeling _okay_ but am looking ahead to how you can make arrays of arrays. And arrays of arrays of arrays ðŸ«£

I can see how that could get complex *__FAST!__*

###Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I got pretty carried away with formatting the actual .rb file when it runs in terminal. I like it but I'm sure there's other ways we will get ruby files to look and behave.

###What questions do you have about Arrays?
How can information be added _in bulk_ to arrays? For example, I added 4 NHL teams, their # of wins, the points per game average, and if they made the playoffs. How could I do this for _all_ 32 teams? (Aside from adding this data by hand.)

My other question: do arrays ever get sorted to be alphabetized or ordered? Or are there ways to make sure value [0] in `nhl_teams` always relates to value [0] in `games_won`? Maybe that's what making an array of multiple arrays is for??

```
array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
array2 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

array_1_2 = [ [array1[0], array2[0]] [..]]
```

I'm not sure, but maybe that's how these things work.
